# Patient Records Changes

## Overview

We've enhanced the patient records functionality to display the "last visited" date along with the report details. This allows doctors to see when a patient was last seen, which is important for tracking patient care.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `ReportModel`

- Added a `lastVisited` field to store the patient's last visited date
- Updated the `toMap` and `fromMap` methods to include this field

### 2. Enhanced `DatabaseService.getPatientReports`

- Modified the method to fetch the patient's data first to get the `lastVisited` field
- Included the `lastVisited` field in each report model

### 3. Improved `PatientDetailsScreen`

- Added state management to store and update the patient data
- Implemented the refresh functionality to reload the latest patient data
- Added a loading indicator while refreshing

### 4. Enhanced Report Display

- Added the "Last Visit" information to each report card
- Updated the report dialog to show more detailed information, including the last visited date

## How It Works

1. When the patient details screen loads, it displays the patient information and reports
2. The `lastVisited` field from the patient data is included in each report
3. Users can refresh the data by clicking the refresh button
4. When viewing a report, users can see when the patient was last visited

## Benefits

- Doctors can quickly see when a patient was last seen without having to look elsewhere
- The information is displayed in context with the report, making it easier to correlate the report with the visit
- The refresh functionality ensures that the most up-to-date information is displayed
