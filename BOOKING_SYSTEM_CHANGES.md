# Booking System Changes

## Problem Fixed

We've fixed an issue where booking a slot on one day was decreasing the available slots on all other days. This happened because the `BookingViewModel` was using a single list of `BookingSlot` objects for all dates.

## Solution

We've updated the `BookingViewModel` to maintain separate slots for each date by:

1. Using a Map to store slots for each date, with the date as the key
2. Creating a new list of slots for each date when it's first selected
3. Ensuring that booking a slot only affects the slots for that specific date

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `BookingViewModel`

- Added a Map to store slots for each date: `Map<String, List<BookingSlot>> _dateSlots`
- Modified the `slots` getter to return slots for the currently selected date
- Added a helper method `_getDateKey` to get a consistent date key
- Updated the `bookSlot` method to work with the date-specific slots

### 2. Updated `BookingScreen`

- Improved the date selection logic to correctly identify the selected date by comparing year, month, and day

## How It Works Now

- Each date has its own set of slots
- When you book a slot on one date, it only decreases the available slots for that specific date
- Other dates maintain their original slot availability

## Testing

You can verify that the changes work correctly by:

1. Selecting a date
2. Booking a slot
3. Selecting a different date
4. Verifying that the slots for the new date are still at full capacity
5. Going back to the first date and verifying that the booked slot is still marked as booked
